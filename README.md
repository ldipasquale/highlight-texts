# Getting started
Run `yarn install` in order to install the project dependencies, and then `yarn dev` to run it.

# Base Instructions
1. You are free to structure the component hierarchy as you deem sensible
2. We suggest you to use lipsum to generate some random text
3. Tests are encouraged. To save on time, don’t aim for 100% coverage, instead focus on testing one part of each piece of the stack or meaningful ones (that could break the flow for example)
4. We’d like the the tagging page to look roughly similar to the screenshot
5. To submit your code challenge, please do it via github, bitbucket or whatever version control you prefer then send us the link. Be sure, it will be accessible and runnable.
6. At least, write down some basic instructions how to run your project
7. Feel free to use create-react-app or whatever boilerplate you prefer.

# Code Instructions
1. We should be able to add and remove tags
2. We should be able to tag any selected text into document
3. Once a text is tagged it should keep highlighted
4. Each tag should show a counter of all text tagged with it
5. We should be able to remove a tag from text into document
6. Once the tag is remove from some text, it should not highlight anymore
